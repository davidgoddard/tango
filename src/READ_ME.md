# Tanda Player Lite

## Overview

The Tanda Player is a music player based on Tandas rather than just tracks.  Over time you can build a library of great tandas and you add these into playlists when needed.  Each tanda may be associated with cortinas and when playing the tanda, Tanda Player will fade out the cortina after some pre-defined period automatically and start the tanda's songs.  

Each song is automatically trimmed of any leading and trailing silence making song spacings consistent and the sound levels are normalised meaning no sudden loud songs or quiet ones.

Playlists may be constrained to a sequence of music styles such as Tango,Tango,Waltz/Vals,Tango,Tango,Milonga and the Tanda Player will only allow suitable songs or tandas to be moved around protecting the playlist from simple mistakes.

Users of the original Tanda Player may point the Tanda Player Lite at the folder where the original library files are stored along with the music and it will import all the song details and classifications, all the tandas and playlists etc. 

## Permissions

Tanda Player Lite is a web application that you can use with music files stored on your own computer. Nothing is sent up to any servers, the web application is a static web site meaning it just has some files that you download and run in your browser.

To be able to run various permissions are reqested by the page including access to your sound cards (which comes up as asking for access to the microphone) and access to the hard disk folders where your music is stored.  You choose the folder.

The web page maintains a local database in the browser of all songs and you can build tandas and manage playlists and next time you open the application all your tandas and playlists will be there.
